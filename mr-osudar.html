      <h1>Mr. Osudar</h1>
      <h2>Field: Education</h2>
      <h2>How computer science is used in their field:</h2>
      <p>Math and computer science teacher Mr. Osudar incorporates computer science daily in his field. Because he teaches computer science. He says that people in the education field use computer science to develop a workflow, which allows them to become
        creative coders. He believes that art seems to be the new driving force of what learning value is, stating that students are only going to learn something if there is an artistic merit to it. If they can’t do something creatively with the computer,
        there is nothing to hold them there.</p>
      <h2>How computer science could be used in their field:</h2>
      <p>Mr. Osudar believes that computer science could be used as genuine employment. He thinks that computers are used to introduce people to meaningful workflows. He says: “At times, some of the workflow is not as meaningful as it could be. People are
        cynical about what it is that they are doing at times and will deem some tasks more meaningful than others. Computer science allows more for educators to put together workflows that better reflect the needs of learnings.”</p>
      <h2>How computer science has been used in their field:</h2>
      <p>Computer science has been used in Mr. Osudar’s field to introduce students to programming. He says that, in his past, computer science was used to give people an introduction to what computer science was. He says that it seemed like something interesting
        to do, but not a long-term place to invest yourself in. His goal is to teach students what computational thinking is. He thinks that the past 10 years was when you started to develop the supreme connection to computers, and thus thinks that the
        curriculum should reflect where computer science is going and what it can do.</p>
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>Computer science, to us, is a method to express ourselves. We use it in our day to day lives without actually realizing it. For example, we use binary and different methods of workflow to complete various tasks, such as completing homework. We can
        also relate computer science to our day to day problem-solving skills, such as when we are calculating the tax of a purchase.</p>
      <p>After interviewing Mr. O and being educated on how computer science is used in the field of education, we have realized that computer science is much more. For example, we have learned that it can be used to get students passionate about computer
        science and engaged to create a proper workflow. It can also be used to teach students what computer science is about, to prepare them for the world, and to teach them not to use a “get-it-done” type manner to complete tasks. They should instead
        delve into and comprehend the information that is being taught to them and its importance. Mr. O reminds us of Khan Academy, as they both provide teaching resources for students to succeed and learn about computer science. We feel that Khan Academy
        and Mr. O’s teaching styles are closely related as both resources get the learners engaged in the task at hand. The government provided the school with amazing teachers and the equipment for students to succeed.</p>
