      <h1>Osudar</h1>
      <h2>Is used in their field:</h2>
      <p>Math and computer science teacher Mr. Osudar incorporates computer science daily in his field. Because he teaches computer science. He says that people in the education field use computer science to develop a workflow, which allows them to become creative coders. He believes that art seems to be the new driving force of what learning value is, stating that students are only going to learn something if there is an artistic merit to it. If they can’t do something creatively with the computer, there is nothing to hold them there.

      <h2>How computer science could be used in the field:</h2>
      <p>Mr. Osudar believes that computer science could be used as genuine employment. He thinks that computers are used to introduce people to meaningful workflows. He says: “At times, some of the workflow is not as meaningful as it could be. People are cynical about what it is that they are doing at times and will deem some tasks more meaningful than others. Computer science allows more for educators to put together workflows that better reflect the needs of learnings.”

      <h2>How it has been used in their field: </h2>
      <p>Computer science has been used in Mr. Osudar’s field to introduce students to programming. He says that, in his past, computer science was used to give people an introduction to what computer science was. He says that it seemed like something interesting to do, but not a long-term place to invest yourself in. His goal is to teach students what computational thinking is. He thinks that the past 10 years was when you started to develop the supreme connection to computers, and thus thinks that the curriculum should reflect where computer science is going and what it can do.
