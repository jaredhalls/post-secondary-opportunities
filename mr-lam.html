      <h2>Field: Product Support</h2>
      <h2>How computer science is used in their field:</h2>
      <p>As a product support technologist, computer science is primarily used in his field to provide technical support for products. This includes debugging, testing and troubleshooting hardware, financial, usage and cost analysis, and accessing the vast
        amount of documentation for the numerous products they support. Computers are also used for frequent communication between management and coworkers.</p>
      <h2>How computer science could be used in their field:</h2>
      <p>Computer science, specifically artificial intelligence, could be used in the future to automate most tasks.</p>
      <h2>How computer science has been used in their field:</h2>
      <p>Previously, testing and financial analysis took a long time to complete due to limited hardware, such as RAM and CPU speeds. The lack of software also meant that they had to manually troubleshoot and perform calculations, which could take many days.
        Documents consisting of many pages also had to be printed out, which could also take a few days.</p>
      <p>Computer science now allows them to very quickly and efficiently support products and also save the environment.</p>
      <h2>Reflection:</h2>
      <p>Mr. Lam has demonstrated how computer science is, can, and could be used in the future in the field of product support. It can be used to help provide technical support for products, such as debugging, testing and troubleshooting hardware. This
        relates to our understanding of computer science as we can use this in our coding practices as well. For example, we are able to solve issues in our code by using these methods to pinpoint the exact cause of why the program doesnâ€™t work. An example
        of this is using the debugger tool or println function in Processing. According to Mr. Lam, computer science can be used as artificial intelligence that can be related to Processing as, you can program Raspberry Pi's in Processing. Raspberry Pi's
        are small computers in which you can attach different hardware systems to. With the modernization of computer science comes a diminution of pollution. Making code more efficient is also improving environment by reducing the runtime. This can be
        related to class as we are constantly trying to make code more efficient.</p>
