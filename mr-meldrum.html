      <h2>Field: Software Engineering</h2>
      <h2>How computer science is used in their field:</h2>
      <p>Computer science is the cornerstone of software engineering. It is a tool that we use when building software solutions to help guide our decision process.</p>
      <h2>How computer science could be used in their field:</h2>
      <p>Many of the difficult computer science problems have been solved. With shareable libraries, everyone is able to benefit from the hard work of a few dedicated computer scientists. This is a great opportunity for the use of machine learning in the
        software development process. At the moment, IDE’s are sophisticated and are able to make informed suggestions based on best practices.</p>
      <p>With the aid of machine learning, IDE’s could become sophisticated enough to act as a peer programmer, making suggestions on algorithms and general solution architecture.</p>
      <h2>How computer science has been used in their field:</h2>
      <p>For many years, software engineers were forced to reinvent the wheel because there were no suitable shared libraries and there was no easy mechanism for sharing code. As networking technologies evolved, people were able to more easily share code
        libraries. Also, with the evolution of higher level programming languages, it has become easier to represent data structures and algorithms in a way that is easier for humans to understand and interact with.</p>
      <p>There are many more tools available for the average software engineer, so they are able to achieve more with less effort.</p>
      <h2>Reflection:</h2>
      <p>Mr. Meldrum demonstrated that computer science can be used as a network and that computer science has developed enough so that it allows for computer scientists to share their code. We can use this in our coding environment by sharing code with
        peers. For example, GitHub is an amazing way to share code with different people. Mr. Meldrum talks about IDE’s improving programmers, which allows them to write code in a more timely manner by completing lines of code or providing suggestions
        that they could add to make the code more efficient. Different people, such as Dan Shiffman, have created IDE’s to help improve code. IDE’s are imperative for programmers, especially students. We use the Processing IDE nearly every day to help
        us program. This has changed our understanding of computer science by demonstrating that a big part of computer science is the environment in which you program in. Different programs have also enabled programmers to complete their desired task
        more efficiently. For example, Java can be used for networking, however, other languages. such as HTML5 and CSS, can be used to create programs or websites. We could have programmed our website earlier on in the course with Processing, but it
        would be a lot harder to create.</p>
