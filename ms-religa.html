      <h2>Field: Programming Analysis at StatCan</h2>
      <h2>How computer science is used in their field:</h2>
      <p>Computer science is used every day in depth. Different softwares are used to gather data from surveys and other sources. The data is then manipulated, analyzed, and disseminated through the use of off-the-shelf software and in-house developed software.
        These software were written in an assortment of programing languages, such as Java, VB.NET, and C#.NET. They also use database languages like SQL, and analytical tools like R and SAS to efficiently work with large amounts of data.</p>
      <h2>How computer science could be used in their field:</h2>
      <p>Something they're planning on doing is data mining. Data mining is taking vast quantities of data and looking for patterns and common information, then using it to supplement data from other sources. They're moving to an external network to improve
        computer security and develop a modern workplace.</p>
      <h2>How computer science has been used in their field:</h2>
      <p>Computer science has been used in her field since the earliest tabulating machines.</p>
      <h2>Reflection:</h2>
      <p>Ms. Religa has demonstrated how computer science can be used to organize data. Computer science can be used in a vast amount of different ways, and this is one of them. Languages like SQL are good languages for databases and can be related once
        again to day to day things. We sort things in our mind unwittingly. Little did we know that we are actually using a method of computer science to do this. Once again, Khan Academy teaches lessons about SQL and how it is used everywhere we go,
        such as grocery stores. She touched on data mining, which is important for organizing large amounts of information. Storing this code in a safe environment can be costly, but with new methods of cloud storage, such as Amazon Web Services, the
        cost has most likely diminished significantly. Ms. Religaâ€™s insights as to what computer science is in her field has developed our understanding of computer science further by giving insights as to how the government uses computer science. In
        StatCan, they have to be able to organize data efficiently.</p>
